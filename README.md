# Node boilerplate

This is a node boilerplate to get going with building an API using node.

## < More coming soon >

## Packages

This repo is a template to get me going quicker. It takes advantage of the following packages:

### Express

This project uses [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) for the application shell. I have then stripped out unnecessary folders (like `public`) and dependencies (like `jade`).

### Linting

[No-Sweatâ„¢ Eslint and Prettier Setup](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos) and related dependencies.

### Testing

This repo uses Cucumber and Chai for feature (or component) testing. I have included some starter tests.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo - `git clone https://github.com/nkhil/node_boilerplate.git`
2. Install dependencies - `npm install`

## Testing

This repo uses Cucumber for feature/component tests.

To run the feature tests - `npm run test:feature`
